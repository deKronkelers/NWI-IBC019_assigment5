	\item %a
	Yes, the sequence could be used to implement a buddy allocation system. You would start at fibonacci number $F_2 = 1$ and then split according to the numbers.

	You would first split the block in $F_3 = 2$ parts if the whole memory is to big, then procedd splitting this block it into $F_4 = 3$ parts and so on.

	If the current block at splitting level $n$ is too big, split it into $F_{n + 1}$ parts and try again.

	\item %b
	With this method you'd get more granularity for the size of memory blocks, potentially wasting less space.
